//This custom class replicates the functionality of the "Gate" node in Blueprint.
//It is designed to be project-agnostic, so implementation should be as simple as adding it to a project in the IDE.
//NOTE: The functions in this custom class can only be directly used in C++!

//HOW TO USE THIS CLASS IN UNREAL PROJECTS:
//1. Add the CustomGate.h file to the Unreal project.
//2. Declare an FGate struct with the proper specifiers.
// UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
//  	FGate Gate = FGate(false);
//3. The bool parameter passed into the constructor determines whether the custom gate will start open or closed.
//4. Use Gate.IsOpen() as a condition to check whether or not logic should be executed.
//5. Call Gate.Open(), Gate.Close(), or Gate.Toggle() as needed.
