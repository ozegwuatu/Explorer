# Explorer
 
Explorer is an Unreal Engine 5 project, in the form of a first-person adventure game. As the name implies, the player will explore various locations and try to make it to the end of each level, with the help of simple items like keys. It is primarily meant to improve my proficiency in level design and environment artistry.
